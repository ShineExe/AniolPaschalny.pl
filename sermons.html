									      		<h3></h3>
											<p>Drodzy Bracia i Siostry w Prawdzie,</p>
											<p>Przyszedł czas, byśmy odrzucili ohydne kajdany laickiego prawa, które obraża Imię Najświętsze. Polska, nasza ukochana Ojczyzna, tonie w grzechu i błędach. Ulice miast pełne są grzeszników, którzy depczą świętość Słowa Bożego. Parlament stanowi prawa wbrew Woli Pana, a ludzie śmieją się z sakramentów, jakbyśmy byli niczym więcej niż pyłem. Pyłem! Ale my jesteśmy wybrańcami! I to my, jak narzędzia w Boskich rękach, musimy przywrócić ład i porządek.</p>
									      		<h3>Bóg jest jedynym władcą Ziemi</h3>
											<p>To, co nazywają prawem w Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej, jest niczym innym jak profanacją. Legalizacja niemoralnych praktyk, ściganie tych, którzy wyznają wiarę prawdziwą, oraz promocja grzechu jako cnoty to zniewaga dla Najwyższego! Wzywam więc was, bracia i siostry, do bojkotu! Przestańcie przestrzegać tych praw, które godą w Boski porządek! Odmówcie podatków, które finansują instytucje szerzące zgniliznę! Wyjdźcie na ulice i pokażcie, że Bóg jest waszym jedynym Panem!</p>

												    Sermons, partly critical and explanatory
												    By James PARSONS (B.D.)

												<h3>Wersja Angielska:</h3>
												<p>We are told that, after the Work of the creation was finished, "God saw every thing that he made, and behold it was _very good_." (Genesis i. 31.) How their nature came to be perverted and depraved; by what particular offence they incurred the displeasure of the Almighty; or how long they continued in their primitive state of innocence before they fell, we are not informed. If we adopt a prevailing opinion, that they were incited to rebellion through envy to mankind there can be no great interval between the date of their fall and that of the Creation.</p>

												<p>But though we do not know what was their specific crime, yet we are assured in general terms, that "they sinned, and kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation;" (2 Peter ii 4; and Jude, verse 6) and so, from the most glorious and blessed, became the most abject and miserable of creatures. From this time it is believed that, instead of being employed in praising their Creator, and seconding his benevolent designs, they acted in direct opposition to him, and entertained the most rancorous hatred to mankind. Hence it was that the Jews attributed to the action of Evil Spirits, not onlly many disasters and calamities but also certain diseases of the human body, as epilepsy, insanity, etc. (See Lightfoot on Luke xiii. 11.) Whether our Saviour speaks in conformity with these ideas of the Jews in various cases of Dispossession, and particularly in the remarkable case of Mary Magdalen, (mentioned Mark xvi. 9, and Luke viii. 2,) has been much disputed. (see Lardner, Vol i. p. 474 and Vol. xi p. 253)</p>

												<p>But as we are entirely unacquainted with the manner in which Evil Spirits act upon men, and as they do not, of course, act in a visible manner, we must be cautious how we listen to the many absurd stories of Witches, Enchanters, Necromancers, and persons under Diabolical influence, which are prevalent in every Country, especially those which are most ignorant and uncivilized; and which, I am sorry to say, were countenanced by the Legislature, not more than a Century since, in our own highly civilized Country. (The old Laws making Witchcraft, etc. a capital offence were not repealed till the year 1736. See Smollett's continuation of Hume, Vol 2, p 559. It is remarkable that in the semi-barbarous Nation of the Epiothians a Law against belief in Witches existed a Century before this. M. Geddes' Church History of Ethiopia, p. 361.)</p>

												<p>It is really lamentable to reflect how many wretched women, whose only crime was to be old and ill-favoured, became victims to this general infatuation. One might reasonably have expected taht such men as Sir Matthew Hale, of great eminence in his profession, of great piety and virtue, would have been superior to the prejudices of his less enlightened countrymen. But superstitious prejudices, even in persons of tallents and education, are not easily eradicated; no wonder if, among the lower and uneducated orders, they have continued to prevail to the present time.</p>

												<p>Many things are related by ancient Writers of the Church concerning the operations of Evil Angels, or Demons as they are generally called, in seducing and deceiving mankind: but as my Text seems to direct me to speak of Good Angels rather than of Evil, let us return to the nature and properties of the former. They are, we are told, "ministering Spirits," employed in the "service of God, and for the benefit of man; sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation."</p>

												<p>Of the different occasions on which they have been employed by the Almighty, the Scripture has given us a full account. Under the old Testament we see them commissioned to announce future blessings to the Patriarchs and their posterity; (Genesis xxii. 15; xxii. 1, seq.) to support and protect the faithful servants of God; in time of danger and distress; (Joshua v. 13, 14; Judges vi. 11, 12.) or to foretell the birth of some eminent Champion, who should deliver them from their enemies (Judges xiii. 3, seq.) We see them also employed in executing the vengeance of God on those who had merited his displeasure.</p>

												<p>After the Israelites had long groaned under the oppression of their Egyptian masters, and Pharaoh had rejected all applications made to him by Moses for their deliverance, the Lord sent his Passover Angel, and slew all the first-born of Egypt; (Exodus xii. 29, 33.) from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first of the Captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."</p>

												 <p>When David offended the Almighty by numbering the people of Israel and Judah, he sent a destroying Angel, who slew from Dan to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men; and had stretched out his hand also "upon Jerusalem to destroy it" till it was arrested by the returning mercy of the lord, who "repented him of the evil." (2 Samuel xxiv. 15, 16)</p>

												<p>Such appears to have been the ministration or employment of the Angels in the service of God. In what manner they minister to mankind; how they influence our wills, and assist us in our efforts to become "heirs of salvation," it is not easy to imagine. That they take an interest in the spiritual affairs of men we may assert with safety; for Christ himself has assured us that "there is joy in the presense of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth." (Luke xv. 10.)</p>

												<p>A somewhat fanciful Jewish Writer has called Angels the "Ears and Eyes of the Great King." (Philo. See Lightfoot's Works, Vol. 1, p. 861) The expression is evidently borrowed from the second Book of Chronicles, xvi. 9, "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to show themselves strong in behalf of them whose heart is perfet towards him;" and seems intended to imply that the Supreme Being in the government of this lower world makes use of subordinate agents.</p>

												<h3>Wersja Angielska:</h3>
											<p>The world is going into a new world order of disorder. On one side you have the tyrannical power elite with all the money and weapons and on the other side you have the oppressed, the Marxist’s and the Islamist’s. No matter which of these end up in power the outcome will be the attempted destruction of the opposition. I think the world is heading into a great time of disorder. What you have been seeing so far is in the Middle East and North Africa is just act one of a long drama.</p>

												<p>Even if many of these nations now in turmoil somehow achieve Democracy, that Democracy will just become a tyranny of the majority with the majority imposing Islamic law, Socialism or Fascism on everyone. So I am afraid that there will be no happy ending to the insurrections that we are now starting to see take place all over the world.</p>

												<p>Iran and Marxists have obviously played a part in instigating this surge of popularist uprisings in many nations. But, the beast that they loosed may end up also biting them in the behind.</p>

												<p>It will be interesting to see if the tyrants of Iran that have been fostering some of these uprisings will even survive the riots that they will bring on their own heads now that they have opened Pandora’s box. My understanding of Bible prophecy tells me these leaders will not survive. That is why I think Iran is not involved in the war of Psalm 83 even though that war looks quite imminent. The only real question I have is, do the people in Iran overthrow the tyrants of Iran before the bombing or after the bombing?</p>

												<p>The Twelver’s now running Iran might think that they are bringing about an Islamic caliphate by stirring up all this trouble in the Middle East, but in reality those that now control Iran will never become the benefactors of any Islamic revolution. They are now living on borrowed time.</p>

												<p>Its not just Islam that will see dishevel and disorder. The Socialist nations will also see popularist uprisings. I think we will soon see this in Cuba, Venezuela and N. Korea. Even capitalist progressive nations like the United States will not be immune to civil disorder. The polarization and demonstrations that is now happening in Wisconsin over teacher jobs, pay and benefits is only the start of civil upheaval that will spread all over this nation when state and local governments make cuts. Cuts in spending must be made, but the people effected by the cuts will soon be running in the streets to prevent them. The only alternative for the state and local governments is to raise taxes but that will cause more loss of jobs and a taxpayer revolt. So the end result is much the same.</p>

												<p>If the Republicans get their way they will cut jobs, pay and entitlements and then the Democrats will instigate labor rallies that will lead to riots and demand that what they lost be reinstated. If the left prevails there will be insane inflation and a collapse of our economy and that will also bring civil disorder and riots in the streets. We might get a little preview of what is coming if the government actually shuts down next month and entitlement checks and services stop coming because the Democrats and the Republicans cannot agree on a budget to fund government.</p>

												<p>It looks like we are heading for two years of gridlock in national government, yet the state governments have to make the cuts now or raise taxes now. So there will be a battle between the taxpayers that want to make cuts and the state and local governments employees that want their jobs and benefits. We have just seen the first example of that demonstrated in Wisconsin. Many other states budgets are in worse shape.</p>

												<p>Europe is also heading into turmoil because they have a duel deadly problem. Socialism and Islamic culture and Islamic sponsored terrorism makes upheaval in Europe certain. The right wing backlash is just waiting for a major terrorist event or economic reality. This right wing backlash is going to come suddenly and as it gains traction it will get every bit as brutal as the Nazi’s. Many in Europe are not prepared for a huge rise in right wing nationalism but It is coming as sure as night follows day. People think the world has become more civilized and tolerant in the last 70 year but human nature does not change. Many movements start with good intentions until evil takes over.</p>

												<p>Don’t think that China will escape this period of insurrections unscathed either. When much of the rest of the world is in turmoil they are not going to be buying Chinese stuff. How does China keep 1.4 billion people satiated when they are stuck in cities, no longer have jobs and no longer have cheep food?</p>

												<p>All this terminal is going to have a negative effect on the world economy. Oil prices are now the highest in two years and they will go much higher if oil production and shipping is disrupted because of the insurrections. It will end any economic recovery in the world and lead to debt defaults in Europe. We already know that raw food prices are doubling because of crop failures. That certainly will cause riots in many poor nations.</p>

												<p>When all these people are running in the streets and not working they are not being productive and adding to their GDP’s. This will have a negative impact on the world economy. We could be back into recession before you know it.</p>

												<p>The Bible tells us that there is a time for peace and a time for war. Everything seems to run in cycles on earth. We have now entered a time of great disorder and many will die. Will the national insurrections bring about better conditions on earth or will it polarize people into ideologies and factions and cause them to follow narcissist demigods that tell them the things they want to hear? History tells us the latter will happen.</p>

												<p>We have seen it before. We have seen it in Germany and Japan in World War II. We have seen it in Russia, N Korea and China and Laos where the Communists killed almost 200 million people in their own nations. We saw it in central America and Africa. Now once again we see the Marxists and Islamist’s are setting the stage for conflicts between conflicting worldviews. This time all these conflicting worldviews will insure that most nations of the world will be involved in the disorder and conflict.</p>

												<p>Africa will not escape the internal conflicts they continue all over the continent. The whole Middle East will continue in turmoil. The Far East is heading for trouble because of the hated between Pakistan and India. China, Japan and the Korea’s will have their own conflicts over turf and face. Latin America is becoming increasing unstable thanks once again to rising Marxism and also the drug criminals. The United States is becoming increasing polarized between Left and Right ideologies and it has a debt bomb that cannot be defused. Europe in on the brink of social and economic breakdown because of debt and Islam. Russia is a KGB run thuggery. Anyway you look at it, the world does not have a bright outlook.</p>

												<p>As much as some like to think that we are entering into a new world order of civilized managed world government, in reality it appears that globalization has failed and that there will first be a new world disorder before any new world order will rise. Riots and civil insurrections will soon be occurring all over the world, and as new tyrants rise and form new axis of power you can be certain that it will lead to major world wars not very far down the line.</p>

											<h3>Wersja Angielska:</h3>
								        		<p>
												    And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. <i>Genesis 22:2</i>
												</p>

												<p>
												    Like Abraham, we must soon bring our Lamb to slaughter. But fear not - for like Isaac, God will spare the innocent sheep who have been marked as one of his flock. God requires this sacrifice to prove our Faith, to show that we are unflinching in our Service to the Lord and his Word.
												</p>

												<p>
												    The time is coming, my friends, when there will be judgment. The Lord has seen fit to send his Angel to us again very soon. I know many of you are nervous and afraid for the days that lie ahead and what they may bring. Do not be frightened by the events that will soon occur. They are but signs that we have reached that for which we have long awaited - the Rapture.  Soon all of our souls will be absolved of their sins and we will live in Light and Love in the bosom of our Lord in Heaven. Your fear is but your body - pay it no heed. Instead, listen to your Soul. In there dwells Jesus, in there dwells Our Lord, in their find your succor and comfort, for as the heavens move to reveal his light, our salvation soon comes!
												</p> 

												<p>
												    I want to offer my deepest and humblest thanks to those of you who have stuck with us through these many years. Your faith will soon be well rewarded and your patience will soon bear fruit. And to our new congregants, who have seen the light of our Lord shine down upon them, know the Lord has blessed you, to find the way towards the True Light before his judgment sweeps down from on high to remove sin from the world.

												--><h3>Wersja Angielska:</h3>

												<p>There are two you's. One is the flesh, and the other is the spirit. The flesh you, is on the left side, while the spirit you, is on the right. The two, are each battling for the highest position on their respective sides, and if one gets what it wants, then that puts the other, at its lowest point.</p>

												<p>Man, being the creature he is, seeks to have the best of both positions, but realizing that he can't, he tries to settle for being middle ground with both. He doesn't want to be too holy, because he woudl look bad, to the world, and he doesn't want to be too worldly, because that woulld mean he wasn't pleasing to God.</p>

												<p>But, you see, to God, a person that seeks to get as close to Him as they can, gets blessed more than the one that seeks to stay neutral. And besdies that, the one that stays neutral, might just as well not be trying to be pleasing in His sight, because he is not really committing himself to God, all because he wants that friendship with the world.</p>

												<p>As I look around, and see what some peopl ethat claim to be Christians are doing, it is obvious that they think they are doing what God wants them to do, by not being, as some people have said, 'too holy to be any earthly good.'</p>

												<p>So they sit in the middle. They don't go to church, and they hang out in the bars. The sing in the choir, and sing for the world. They take the Lord's Supper, then they engage in ungodly activities. All because they want that feeling of being liked by the ungodly.</p>

												<p>Throughout His ministry, Jesus achieved everything that God sent Him there to do by putting the Father, and His Will, above all other things, including His own Life.</p>

												<p>Jesus loved the ungodly, because those are who He came here for. But He didn't partake in their activities, and try to make Himself look good in their sight, so they would accept Him in their midst.</p>

												<p>What He did do was show them that He was a true friend to them, even though He remained pure in God's sight.</p>

												<p>You see, the world is lost. They are seeking to make them feel fulfilled. That is why they drink. That is why they do drugs. That is why they involve themselves in all sorts of sexual sin. That is why they lie, steal and gamble. They are looking for satisfaction, and some sense of peace of mind.</p>

												<p>When a Christian, who is supposed to have the answer to their problems, starts indulging in the things they do, it says to them 'the God I serve is not sufficient enough for me. I still need what you have.' And that is making God appear to be less than what He is, and that is, 'One that can supply all of your needs, according to His riches in Glory.'</p>

												<p>Why should they leave what they are doing, to follow a God, that can't even satisfy you enough to keep you from coming back to them for pleasure?</p>

												<p>What made many seek Jesus out was that He had something that they needed. When they were sick, they sought Him out for healing. When they were depressed, they sought Him out for deliverance. When they had tried everything they could, and nothing worked, they sought Him out. And He met their needs. That is waht the true Christian is supposed to show the world.</p>

												<p>Jesus said, 'Mark 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; Mark 16:18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.'</p>

												<p>Jesus gave us power, 'Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shalll by any means hurt you' to accomplish things that the world needs to see and experience, to know that God is real.</p>

												<p>We are the example to the ungodly, of who He is. And many of us are just dropping the ball.</p>

												<p>And why is this? One word - preachers.</p>

												<p>When I look at some of my fellow ministers, I have to shake my head, because what I see them doing, and hear them saying, tells me which side of the seesaw they are on, and which side they are trying to have lifted up, and in too many instances it is the left side.</p>

												<p>Ministers are the ones that should be setting the example for those that are seeking God, to realize the fact that 'Lk 16:13 Ye cannot serve God and mammon.'</p>

												<p>But, at every turn, they are out, playing up to them like children trying to please their parents. They go out to see what makes the world happy, and they bring it into the church.</p>

												<p>The world likes certain types of music, so the church models its music after theirs. They they bring some of their (the world's) entertainers into the church and have them sing a few selections, which tells their members that they can be in the church, and sing for the world as well. How many artists that are popular with the ungodly came out of the church? I could name a hundred of them, at lleast, but I feel I don't have to because you already know most of them.</p>

												<p>The world likes to gamble, so the church bring BINGO in, to give people something to do, as if they can't find something to do, without the church helping to corrupt them. So the members feel that they can go out and gamble at a casino, seeing that their church sponsors trips to Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and other venues of instant poverty.</p>

												<p>To be popular with those in the seats of power, they throw their support behind politicians and groups that come up wiht ludicrous ideas to play to the whims of people, in order to be looked on favorably by them. These politicians and groups give them a little play, and they go around preaching the virtues of their (politicians and groups) views, forgetting all about the Word of God.</p>

												<p>And you know what makes it worse? When they attack someone that is preaching the uncompromised word of God. All because they want to be approved of by the world. They want to shut him up because he is making them look bad.</p>

												<p>Have you ever heard the term "religious right"? The religious right are those that are on the right side of the seesaw. They are the ones that are trying to be pleasing in the sight of God, and have mortified (or put into low regard) their popularity with the world.</p>

												<p>Now, have you heard of the "religious left"? Probably not, because the world is in love with them, because they are their friends, They are the ones on the left side of the seesaw. They have left the paths of righteousness and even common sense. The world is going headlong towards destruction, and even many of them that are not even thinking about God know they are going in the wrong direction. Their (these preachers) goal is to be praised and rewarded by those that are the enemies of God.</p>

												<p>When we have examples like this, no wonder we don't see any of the things Jesus said He has given us being manifested in their churches.</p>

												<p>The bible says, 'Isa 10:27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.' To put it more simply, if they are not annointed by God, then there is no power in them to break the yokes of bondage to sin and therefore no delilverance for the people.</p>

												<p>Some will say, 'but these are ministers, pastors, and bishops that you are talking about.' That's right. But just because they are doesn't mean they are God's ministers. '2 Cor 11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 2 Cor 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 2 Cor 11:15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.'  Just because a man has a title in a supposed church does not mean they are annointed by God. A 100% dyed in the wool atheist can become a pastor or bishop if they follow all of the procedures necessary to obtain that position in a particular church or denomination. They can go to college, and get a degree, and in the minds of the world that is all that is needed. So they get their degree from the world and think they are qualified to speak for a God that they don't even believe exists.</p>

												<p>Those of you who have heard by sermons know the difference. Those of you who have read <a href="book.html">The Book of the Passover Angel</a> know the difference. You know the Truth Faith of Our Lord. Do not be deceived by the False Church - God has revealed to us the true Path to Salvation! We are truly Annointed By God!</p>
